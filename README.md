#Base Building Blocks Theme

##The Module
[Base Building Blocks Module](https://github.com/patrickocoffeyo/BaseBuildingBlocksModule) allows you to add custom Bootstrap-ized elements, like configurable Bootstrap menu blocks, navbars (including a nice Administration navbar) carousels from content types, and more. It's pretty much a staple for using this theme.

## Installation
Base Building Blocks is easy to install just **enable** it. The latest version of Bootstrap is included in the repo, so you don't need to add any libraries or modules to make this theme work. To get **Grunt** working, just <code>cd</code> to the theme root and run <code>npm install</code> and then, when you want to run grunt, <code>grunt watch</code>. For more detailed instructions, see the theme documentation

## Extension
This project is meant to be a base theme, meaning it's built for you to take, and build-upon, or use as a parent theme.
