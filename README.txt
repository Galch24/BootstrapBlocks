Extension
This project is meant to be a base theme, meaning it's built for you to take, and build-upon. :) 

There's also a https://github.com/patrickocoffeyo/BaseBuildingBlocksModule that ships with some cool stuff, like configurable Bootstrap Menu blocks (with dropdowns and icons), a Bootstrap administration navbar block, and more. It's pretty much a staple for using this theme.
